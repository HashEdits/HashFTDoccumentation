# Upgrade face tracking version

Every so often I will revisit some of my face tracking add-ons to keep them up to date with my newer findings, here's a guide on how to update:

## Create prefabs of your avatar(s)

Drag and drop your avatar(s) in your unity file explorer and click ``Create Original Prefab`` if a dialog box opens

## Delete the fbx

delete the folder  ``Hash's_Things/AvatarName/fbx``

## Patch the model like you did the first time

- Go at the top of your Unity window and click on ``Tools``->``Hash``->``AvatarName``

>Some will have multiple options for different prefabs, you're free to do the one you want or all of them

- Click the ``Patch`` button on the window that oppens

## Make sure you are using the same animation controllers as the base FT prefab

- Navigate to ``Hash's_Things/AvatarName/prefabs``
- Right Click â†’ Properties
- Scroll down and look at the animation controllers
- Select your avatar 
- Make sure that the animation controllers and parameters are matching

## You're done!
